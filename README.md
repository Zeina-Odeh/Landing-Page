# Landing Page Project

This project implements a single-page application that dynamically builds a navigation menu, scrolls to anchors from the navigation, and highlights sections in the viewport upon scrolling.

## Description

The application uses JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and create a responsive user experience. It dynamically builds a navigation menu based on the sections present in the HTML. When a user scrolls through the page, the corresponding navigation item is highlighted, and sections in the viewport are visually indicated. Additionally, it includes functionality to collapse sections and scroll to the top of the page.

## Features

- Dynamically builds a navigation menu based on sections in the HTML.
- Scrolls to anchors smoothly from the navigation menu.
- Highlights active sections and corresponding navigation items.
- Collapses sections with optional content display toggling.
- Shows a scroll-to-top button after scrolling down, hiding it after a period of inactivity.

## Dependencies

This project does not require any external libraries or dependencies beyond standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Scroll through the page to see navigation highlighting and section collapsing in action.
4. Click on navigation links to scroll to the respective sections.
